The quick sort algorithm works with an input file. 
It can create an output file with the sorted numbers. 
It also produces the execution time but it is tricky of when it lists the number without rounding. 

The input file generator creates 25 input files from -500 to 500 with decimals. It sorts them into the appropriate folder. 
The makefile also works in the command prompt with g++ -c Lee_Christian_QuickSort.cpp. Then typing ./Lee_Christian_QuickSort.
It will sort the input file and then produce an output file.
